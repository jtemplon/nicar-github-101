Welcome to Github 101 at NICAR. Here is some information that you might find useful.

## Terms

*Github*: Github is a place to collaborate and share code. It also allows for source control. Here are three reasons you might want to use Github:

- Learn and build off of other people's work.
- Share your work with the world.
- Track changes.

*Repository*: `nicar-github-101` is an example of a repository, it typically contains code and text explaining what that code does.

*README*: This is a README. It is an explanation of why the repository was created. It could also contain a longer methodology. For instance, the README for my [figure skating analysis](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-02-olympic-figure-skating-analysis) walks you through the process of acquiring and analyzing the data. READMEs are typically written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), which is why the file extension is .md.

## Ways to Github

There are basically three options for creating and updating Github accounts.

1. Online interface. (What we're going to look at today.)
2. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Command Line

## Commands

*Clone*: Make a copy of the repository so that you can either have a personal copy or make changes to it. (Or both!)

*Commit*: Make a set of temporary changes permanent. (i.e. After you've edited a file.) Commit's typically have commit messages that explain why you made the changes.

*Pull Request*: How you submit your changes to other people's projects.

## Examples of Newsrooms with Github Repositories

1. [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews)

4. [USA Today](https://github.com/USATODAY)
5. [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/FiveThirtyEight) (Not sure if it's being updated.)
